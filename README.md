# QLC-Fixtures
QLC++ fixture definitions that aren't published yet.

I created this library for myself because I couldn't find these fixtures anywhere else.
Not all of them are 100% complete; some are missing different DMX channel modes.
However, I have used these successfully.
They were designed for the current version 4.x of QLC++.

The library contains fixture definitions for the following fixtures:

- **Cameo Sunbeam**
- **Eurolite Pix Strobe**
- **Eurolite STP-10 Sunbar**
- **Laserworld EL-300 RGB**

Feel free to add more fixtures or contribute by completing definitions or fixing bugs.
